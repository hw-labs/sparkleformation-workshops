## This file provides the sfn configuration. The .sfn may be JSON, YML, or Ruby. We've opted for Ruby for the greatest programmatic potential, and because the syntax mirrors that used by SparkleFormation's template files.

## Start a new configuration block.
Configuration.new do
  ## Access AWS Credentials via Environment variables.
  credentials do
    aws_access_key_id ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID']

    aws_region ENV['AWS_REGION']
    ## sfn requires a bucket region in order to access the correct API
    ## endpoint for nested templates (see below). If a bucket region
    ## is not set, we'll use the aws_region.
    aws_bucket_region ENV['AWS_BUCKET_REGION'] || ENV['AWS_REGION']

  ## exist.
